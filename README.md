This model was created as part of the project: CONNECTED MATHEMATICS: MAKING SENSE OF COMPLEX PHENOMENA THROUGH BUILDING 
OBJECT-BASED PARALLEL MODELS (OBPML).  The project gratefully acknowledges the support of the National Science Foundation 
(Applications of Advanced Technologies Program) -- grant numbers RED #9552950 and REC #9632612.


This model was developed at the MIT Media Lab using CM StarLogo.  See Resnick, M. (1994) "Turtles, Termites and Traffic Jams: 
Explorations in Massively Parallel Microworlds."  Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.  Adapted to StarLogoT, 1997, as part of the Connected 
Mathematics Project.


This model was converted to NetLogo as part of the projects: PARTICIPATORY SIMULATIONS: NETWORK-BASED DESIGN FOR SYSTEMS LEARNING 
IN CLASSROOMS and/or INTEGRATED SIMULATION AND MODELING ENVIRONMENT. The project gratefully acknowledges the support of the 
National Science Foundation (REPP & ROLE programs) -- grant numbers REC #9814682 and REC-0126227. Converted from StarLogoT to
